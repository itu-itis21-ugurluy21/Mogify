## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **MogApp**! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application. Your privacy is critically important to us. Our goal is to provide a powerful fitness analysis tool while respecting your data and privacy at every step.

This policy explains **what information we collect**, **why we need it**, and **how we use it** to provide our services.

## 2. Information We Collect
To provide our service, we collect the following types of information:

- **Account Information.** When you sign up and log in, we collect your **email address** and **display name** from your authentication provider (e.g., Google). This is used to create and secure your personal account.
- **Camera and Image Data.** To perform fitness analysis, the app requires access to your device’s **camera**. You use the camera to take photos of your physique.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We are committed to using your data only for the purposes of improving your fitness journey.

- **Email Address.** Used solely for **account management**, such as authentication, security, and restoring your subscription or data across multiple devices. We **do not** send marketing emails unless you explicitly **opt in**.
- **Camera and Image Data.** This is the core of our service:
  - When you take a photo within the app, it is sent **securely** to our AI servers for analysis.
  - The AI processes the image to calculate **body composition metrics** and generate **personalized fitness suggestions**.
  - **We do not store your photos.** Images are processed in real time and then **immediately and permanently deleted** from our servers after the analysis is complete.
  - We only store the **resulting fitness data** (e.g., body fat percentage, muscle mass metrics) associated with your account to help track your progress.

---

## 4. Permissions We Request
- **Camera Permission** (`android.permission.CAMERA`): Required so you can take photos directly within the app for analysis. The app cannot function without this permission. We do **not** access your camera at any other time.

## 5. Data Security
We take the security of your data seriously. We use **industry-standard security measures**, including **encryption**, to protect your information during transmission between your device and our servers. Access to your personal data is **strictly limited** to authorized personnel and systems that require it to operate the service.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
PhysiqueAI is **not intended** for use by individuals **under the age of 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will **delete it immediately**.
